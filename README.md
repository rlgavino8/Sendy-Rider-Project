# Sendy-Rider-Project

### Objective
This project aims to predict the estimated time of arrival for the motorbike deliveries provided by the Sendy delivery service in Nairobi. Given the details of a Sendy order, this model will use historic data to predict an accurate time for the arrival of the rider at the destination of a package. Data is provided by Sendy and insight2impact.
